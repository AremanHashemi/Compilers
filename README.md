A compiler for a new language. Compiler is written in Haskell, and uses C for the runtime garbage collecting

Language features:
	Double-word
	Nested complex expression evaluation
	Tuples
	Fuctions
	Recursion & tail recursion optimization 
	Static Dynamic error checking:
		- Static & Dynamic type checking
		- Airity of funciton calls
		- Static function and variable defined checking
		- Scope Checking
		- Duplication shadowing checking
		- Overflow checking 
		- Well formed expr checking
		- Dynamically checks heapspace before allocation
	Stack and heap variable binding
	Complex expression evaluation  
	Tags for conditional jumping
	Smart automated garbage collection in C
